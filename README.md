# Google Play Unreal Engine Plugin

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This plugin is for Android apps & games only.

This repository enables you to use the Google Play plugin in Unreal Engine.

This Google Play plugin provides C++ and Blueprint interfaces for accessing Google Play in-game features at runtime from within the Unreal Engine. The plugin streamlines the integration process of the Play features by using the Native SDK.

With this plugin, you can integrate one or more of the following features into your game:

- **Play Integrity & Licensing:** Check that your game is unmodified, installed by Google Play, and running on a genuine Android device (or a genuine instance of Google Play Games for PC). Your game’s backend server can respond when you detect risky traffic to prevent unauthorized access and cheating. Refer to the [documentation](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity) for more information.
- **Play In-App Updates:** Prompt users to update to the latest version of your game, when a new version is available, without the user needing to visit the Play Store. Refer to the [documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-updates/unreal-engine) for more information.
- **Play In-App Reviews:** Prompt users to submit Play Store ratings and reviews without leaving your game. Refer to the [documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-review/unreal-engine) for more information.
